# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: SYSTEM COMPLETE - Final Documentation & Submission

### Just Completed
âœ… **Phase 3 - AI Integration & Report Generation (COMPLETED)**
- **OpenAI Integration**: Successfully integrated OpenAI GPT-5-mini for Hebrew report generation
- **AI Service Implementation**: Complete AI service with Hebrew system prompts for regulatory guidance
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Full working system from React questionnaire â†’ FastAPI backend â†’ AI report generation
- **Frontend Development**: React TypeScript frontend with Hebrew RTL support and questionnaire interface
- **API Integration**: Fixed CORS, request formatting, and data model compatibility issues
- **Report Generation**: Tested and working AI-powered Hebrew compliance report generation

âœ… **Complete System Integration**
- **Frontend**: React app with Hebrew questionnaire form, loading states, and report display
- **Backend**: FastAPI with AI integration, regulatory data matching, and report generation endpoints
- **AI Service**: OpenAI GPT-5-mini powered service generating personalized Hebrew regulatory compliance reports
- **Data Pipeline**: Complete flow from business characteristics to AI-generated actionable guidance

### Currently Working On
ðŸ“‹ **Final Documentation & Submission Preparation**
- Create comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Document AI tools usage throughout development (required for submission)
- Take required screenshots of working system (3 screenshots needed)
- Prepare final submission materials and repository organization

### Immediate Next Steps
ðŸ“‹ **Documentation Completion**
- README with setup instructions for both frontend and backend
- AI tools documentation (Claude Code, OpenAI API usage, prompts used)
- Architecture overview and system flow documentation

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Backend Technology**: Switched to Python/FastAPI (user preference)
  - FastAPI for high-performance API with automatic documentation
  - Pydantic for data validation and type safety
  - SQLAlchemy for potential database integration
- **Package Management**: Using uv instead of pip (user preference)
- **AI Integration**: Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

### Project Scope Refinement
- Focus on restaurant licensing data (subset of full document as allowed)
- Prioritize functional system over advanced UI/UX
- AI-first approach with comprehensive tool usage documentation

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **Hebrew Text Processing**: Need to ensure proper encoding for Hebrew content in PDF/Word files
- **AI Output Quality**: Must ensure generated reports are relevant and actionable
- **Data Extraction Complexity**: PDF/Word parsing may be more complex than anticipated

### Project Management
- **Tight Timeline**: 5 days remaining (September 9-14, 2024)
- **AI Documentation**: Must track every AI tool interaction for final submission
- **Quality vs. Speed**: Balance between feature completeness and code quality

### User Experience Considerations
- **Simplicity**: Keep questionnaire under 10 minutes completion time  
- **Clarity**: Transform legal language into business-friendly guidance
- **Actionability**: Provide specific next steps and priorities

## Resources Available

### Source Documents
- **×ž×©×™×ž×”.md**: Complete Hebrew assignment specification (analyzed)
- **18-07-2022_4.2A.pdf** (502,109 bytes): Restaurant licensing regulations
- **18-07-2022_4.2A.docx** (142,894 bytes): Same content in Word format

### Development Tools
- **Claude Code**: Current AI development assistant
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development environment (to be used)
- **UV**: Python package manager (user preference)
- **Python/FastAPI**: Core technology stack

## Success Metrics for Current Phase

### Completion Criteria
- [x] All memory bank files updated and complete
- [x] Source data analysis completed with structured extraction strategy (data_extraction_plan.md)
- [x] Data extraction implementation completed (data_extractor.py)
- [ ] Business logic matching engine implementation
- [ ] Digital questionnaire API design and development

### Quality Indicators
- [x] Memory bank provides clear guidance for future development sessions
- [x] Data processing strategy handles Hebrew content correctly (PyMuPDF implementation)
- [x] Pure extraction approach preserves original regulatory context for AI processing
- [ ] Matching engine accurately filters requirements based on business characteristics

## Notes and Observations

### Key Insights from Task Analysis
- **AI Integration is Core**: Not an add-on feature but the primary differentiator
- **Hebrew Language Support**: Critical for processing source documents and user interface
- **Documentation Requirements**: Extensive documentation needed for academic submission
- **Time Sensitivity**: Aggressive timeline requires focused prioritization

### Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, build complexity gradually
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI tools throughout (document usage)  
- **Quality Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation throughout process
- **User-Centric Validation**: Regular testing of AI output quality and relevance

## Communication Notes
- User prefers uv over pip for Python package management
- User wants Python/FastAPI backend (confirmed during setup)
- User expects progress tracking through PROJECT_PLAN.md checkboxes
- **User is not using .cursorrules**: Focus exclusively on memory bank system for context preservation
- Next review expected after Phase 1.2 completion
