# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & Setup

### Just Completed
âœ… **Phase 1.1 - Repository Setup (COMPLETED)**
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python/FastAPI project
- Set up project directory structure (backend/, frontend/, data/, docs/, tests/, scripts/)
- Python virtual environment setup (using uv as requested by user)
- Created requirements.txt with FastAPI, AI SDKs, and all necessary dependencies
- Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to mark Phase 1.1 tasks as completed

### Currently Working On
ðŸ”„ **Memory Bank Update (IN PROGRESS)**
- Updating all memory bank files to reflect current project state
- Documenting technology stack changes (Node.js â†’ Python/FastAPI)
- Capturing recent accomplishments and current status

### Immediate Next Steps
ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1.2 - Memory Bank Completion**
- Complete all required memory bank files documentation
- Set up AI tools usage log (as required by assignment)
- Set up development workflow documentation

ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1.3 - Data Analysis & Processing Setup** 
- Analyze provided PDF/Word documents (18-07-2022_4.2A files)
- Extract and structure relevant licensing data using Python libraries
- Create data schema for restaurant licensing requirements

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Backend Technology**: Switched to Python/FastAPI (user preference)
  - FastAPI for high-performance API with automatic documentation
  - Pydantic for data validation and type safety
  - SQLAlchemy for potential database integration
- **Package Management**: Using uv instead of pip (user preference)
- **AI Integration**: Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

### Project Scope Refinement
- Focus on restaurant licensing data (subset of full document as allowed)
- Prioritize functional system over advanced UI/UX
- AI-first approach with comprehensive tool usage documentation

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Challenges
- **Hebrew Text Processing**: Need to ensure proper encoding for Hebrew content in PDF/Word files
- **AI Output Quality**: Must ensure generated reports are relevant and actionable
- **Data Extraction Complexity**: PDF/Word parsing may be more complex than anticipated

### Project Management
- **Tight Timeline**: 5 days remaining (September 9-14, 2024)
- **AI Documentation**: Must track every AI tool interaction for final submission
- **Quality vs. Speed**: Balance between feature completeness and code quality

### User Experience Considerations
- **Simplicity**: Keep questionnaire under 10 minutes completion time  
- **Clarity**: Transform legal language into business-friendly guidance
- **Actionability**: Provide specific next steps and priorities

## Resources Available

### Source Documents
- **×ž×©×™×ž×”.md**: Complete Hebrew assignment specification (analyzed)
- **18-07-2022_4.2A.pdf** (502,109 bytes): Restaurant licensing regulations
- **18-07-2022_4.2A.docx** (142,894 bytes): Same content in Word format

### Development Tools
- **Claude Code**: Current AI development assistant
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development environment (to be used)
- **UV**: Python package manager (user preference)
- **Python/FastAPI**: Core technology stack

## Success Metrics for Current Phase

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All memory bank files updated and complete
- [ ] Source data analysis completed with structured extraction strategy
- [ ] Basic FastAPI application structure created
- [ ] AI integration approach defined and initial testing completed

### Quality Indicators
- Memory bank provides clear guidance for future development sessions
- Data processing strategy handles Hebrew content correctly
- FastAPI setup follows best practices with proper validation
- AI integration demonstrates clear value proposition

## Notes and Observations

### Key Insights from Task Analysis
- **AI Integration is Core**: Not an add-on feature but the primary differentiator
- **Hebrew Language Support**: Critical for processing source documents and user interface
- **Documentation Requirements**: Extensive documentation needed for academic submission
- **Time Sensitivity**: Aggressive timeline requires focused prioritization

### Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, build complexity gradually
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI tools throughout (document usage)  
- **Quality Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation throughout process
- **User-Centric Validation**: Regular testing of AI output quality and relevance

## Communication Notes
- User prefers uv over pip for Python package management
- User wants Python/FastAPI backend (confirmed during setup)
- User expects progress tracking through PROJECT_PLAN.md checkboxes
- **User is not using .cursorrules**: Focus exclusively on memory bank system for context preservation
- Next review expected after Phase 1.2 completion
