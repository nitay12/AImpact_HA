# Project Brief: AImpact HA - Business Licensing Assessment System

## Project Overview
**AImpact HA** is an AI-powered business licensing assessment system designed to help business owners in Israel understand and comply with regulatory requirements specific to their business type and characteristics.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive system that:
1. Processes existing licensing data from regulatory documents
2. Collects business-specific information through a digital questionnaire

### Target Users
- Business owners in Israel (initially focusing on restaurants/food service)
- Entrepreneurs planning to start new businesses
- Business consultants helping clients with regulatory compliance

### Key Success Criteria
1. **Functional End-to-End System**: Complete working solution from data input to report generation
2. **AI Integration**: Central use of language models for intelligent report generation
3. **Data Processing**: Successfully process and structure regulatory data from source documents
4. **User Experience**: Simple, clear questionnaire and comprehensive reporting
5. **Documentation**: Full technical documentation and AI tool usage tracking

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Restaurant/food service licensing data processing (subset of full document)
- Digital questionnaire for business characteristics
- AI-powered report generation using LLM APIs
- RESTful API backend
- Functional frontend interface
